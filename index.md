# Quantum Development Kit Samples


These samples demonstrate the use of Q# and the Quantum Development Kit for a variety of different quantum computing tasks.

Most samples can be used with Q# directly at the command-line or in Jupyter Notebook, while other samples demonstrate how to use Q# together with other platforms, such as Python or .NET.
A small number of the samples have additional installation requirements beyond those for the rest of the Quantum Development Kit.
These are noted in the README.md files for each sample, along with complete installation instructions.
