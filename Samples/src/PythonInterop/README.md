# Python Interoperability #

This sample demonstrates the use of Python as a classical host language for calling into Q#.

For details on how to get started with Python and Q#, please see the [Getting Started with Python guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/python).

## Running the Sample ##

Once you have the Python client up and running, the host program for this sample can be run like a normal Python script:

NB: If you installed the `qsharp` package into a virtual env or conda env, make sure that you have the right environment activated when you run the sample.

```bash
cd Quantum/Samples/src/PythonInterop/
python host.py
```
